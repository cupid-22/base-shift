Dependency Management with Poetry
=================================

For the Only Menus project, we've chosen Poetry as our dependency management tool. This document explains the rationale behind this choice and compares it with other popular options.

Why Poetry?
-----------

Poetry is a modern dependency management and packaging tool for Python projects. We selected it for the following reasons:

1. All-in-one solution: Poetry handles dependency management, virtual environment creation, and project packaging.
2. Dependency resolution: It uses advanced algorithms to resolve dependencies, reducing conflicts.
3. Lock file: The `poetry.lock` file ensures consistent environments across all development machines.
4. Active development: Poetry is actively maintained and regularly updated with new features.
5. Built-in publishing: It can directly publish packages to PyPI, which may be useful for future development.

Comparison with Other Tools
---------------------------

Pyenv
^^^^^

Pros of Pyenv:
- Excellent for managing multiple Python versions
- Works well alongside other tools

Cons of Pyenv:
- Doesn't manage project dependencies
- Requires additional setup, especially on Windows

Poetry vs Pyenv:
Poetry manages dependencies and virtual environments, while Pyenv focuses solely on Python version management. For our project, Poetry's all-in-one approach is more suitable.

Requirements.txt + venv
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pros of Requirements.txt + venv:
- Simple and widely used
- Compatible with most Python tools and CI/CD systems

Cons of Requirements.txt + venv:
- Requires manual management of virtual environments
- No built-in dependency resolution
- Lacks a lock file for ensuring consistent environments

Poetry vs Requirements.txt + venv:
Poetry offers more features and automation, making it easier to manage complex projects like Only Menus.

Pipenv
^^^^^^

Pros of Pipenv:
- Combines virtual environment and dependency management
- Generates a lock file for consistent environments
- Easy to use with straightforward commands

Cons of Pipenv:
- Can be slower than other tools when resolving dependencies
- Development has slowed down recently

Poetry vs Pipenv:
While both tools offer similar features, Poetry's active development, advanced dependency resolution, and additional packaging features make it a better choice for our project.

Conclusion
----------

Poetry provides the best balance of features, ease of use, and modern tooling for the Only Menus project. Its comprehensive approach to dependency management, virtual environments, and packaging aligns well with our project's needs and future scalability.
