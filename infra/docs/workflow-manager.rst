Workflow Manager:
Job Template Store: Store predefined workflow templates in a centralized repository. These templates define the sequence of jobs that need to be executed.
State Management: Use a caching tool like Redis to manage the state of each workflow. This state includes which job is currently running, which jobs are pending, and any relevant data that needs to be passed between jobs.
Job Selection: The workflow manager picks the appropriate job from the template store based on the current state and triggers it.
2. Pod Deployment & Resource Optimization:
On-Demand Pod Deployment: Deploy pods on demand when a job needs to be executed. Pods should be lightweight and designed to spin up quickly, perform the job, and then scale down or terminate when the job is complete.
Idle Pods: Keep pods idle when not in use, consuming minimal resources. They only become active when the workflow manager triggers them based on the current workflow state.
Resource Efficiency: This approach ensures that resources are not consumed unnecessarily, aligning with your goal of keeping the local setup independent of any cloud setup requirements.
3. Workflow Orchestration Tools:
Apache Airflow: Airflow is excellent for managing complex workflows, particularly in data pipelines. It can trigger tasks based on dependencies and handle retries and timeouts.
Argo Workflows: Argo is Kubernetes-native and works well for orchestrating complex workflows in a Kubernetes environment. It supports DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)-based workflows and is highly scalable.
Kafka: Kafka can be used for event-driven workflows, where jobs are triggered by specific events. Itâ€™s great for decoupling services and ensuring that they only react to relevant events.
Azure Logic Apps: Logic Apps are ideal for integrating different services and managing workflows through a visual designer, especially if you're working within the Azure ecosystem.
Temporal.io: Another option, Temporal, allows you to manage complex workflows, retries, and stateful long-running processes. It integrates well with Kubernetes.
4. Flow of Execution:
Workflow Initialization: The workflow manager initializes a workflow by selecting a job template from the store.
State Check: It checks the current state of the workflow from Redis.
Pod Triggering: Based on the state, the workflow manager triggers the appropriate pod to execute the job.
Job Execution: The pod executes the job and reports back to the workflow manager.
State Update: The workflow manager updates the state in Redis and checks if the next job in the sequence needs to be triggered.
Completion: The workflow continues until all jobs are executed, at which point the workflow is marked as complete.
This setup keeps the system highly modular, efficient, and scalable, while also ensuring that resources are used effectively.
