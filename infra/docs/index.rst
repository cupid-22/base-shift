Step 1: Set Up the Development Environment
Tools Required:
Docker: For containerization of microservices.
Kubernetes: For orchestration (can be set up locally with Minikube or on a cloud provider like AWS or GCP).
PostgreSQL and MongoDB: As the primary databases.
Kafka: For event-driven architecture.
React.js: For the frontend.
Step 2: Repository Structure
Monorepo vs. Polyrepo: Decide on whether to use a monorepo (all services in one repo) or polyrepo (separate repos for each service).
Directory Structure:
/frontend: React frontend.
/services/authentication: Microservice for authentication.
/services/order-management: Microservice for order management.
/services/inventory-management: Microservice for inventory.
/services/manufacturing-line: Microservice for manufacturing management.
/services/analytics: Microservice for analytics.
/infra: Infrastructure as code (Terraform, Helm charts, etc.).
Step 3: Start with Core Microservices
Authentication Service:
Implement OAuth2.0/JWT-based authentication.
Set up a PostgreSQL database for user credentials.
Order Management Service:
Implement order creation, tracking, and management.
Integrate with the frontend and set up communication with inventory and manufacturing services.
Inventory Management Service:
Implement inventory tracking and low stock notifications.
Connect it with the order management service.
Step 4: Frontend Development
React.js:
Set up the white-labeled frontend with dynamic theming.
Implement basic UI for login, dashboard, and order management.
Communication with Backend:
Implement API calls to backend microservices.
Use WebSockets for real-time updates (e.g., order status).
Step 5: Containerization
Docker:
Create Dockerfiles for each microservice.
Containerize the frontend as well.
Docker Compose:
For local development, set up a Docker Compose file to bring up all services.
Step 6: Orchestration and Deployment
Kubernetes:
Deploy the services to a Kubernetes cluster.
Use Helm charts for easier deployment and management.
CI/CD Pipeline:
Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate building, testing, and deploying the services.
Step 7: Integrations and External Services
Payment Gateway:
Integrate a payment gateway for processing transactions.
External CRM and Shipping Providers:
Set up connections to external CRM systems and shipping providers.
Step 8: Monitoring and Logging
Prometheus & Grafana:
Set up monitoring dashboards to track service health and performance.
ELK Stack:
Centralize logging for all services.
Step 9: Testing and Quality Assurance
Unit and Integration Tests:
Write tests for each service.
End-to-End Testing:
Test the complete workflow, from user login to order completion.
Step 10: Documentation and Final Adjustments
Update Documentation:
Ensure all implementation details are documented.
Final Testing:
Conduct stress tests and resolve any last-minute issues.
