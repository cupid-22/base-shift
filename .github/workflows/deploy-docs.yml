# Explanation:
#Trigger Conditions:
#
#paths: The paths filter in the on block specifies that the workflow should only run when files in docs/ or application/**/docs/ are modified.
#'docs/**': Triggers the workflow for any changes within the docs/ directory, including subdirectories.
#'application/**/docs/**': Triggers the workflow for any changes in docs/ subdirectories within any application/ subdirectory. The double asterisk (**) allows for matching any directory depth within application/.
#Build and Deploy Steps:
#
#The steps in this workflow remain the same as the general build and deploy steps discussed earlier, but now they will only execute when the specified directories are modified.
